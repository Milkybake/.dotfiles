#A file with things to do - not in any specific order.

1) Add install.sh script for dotfiles
2) Add git status support to bash
3) Look into zsh themes such as Powerline10
4) Work out what to do with .profile 
5) Bash functions files
6) Add gitignore? Add README
7) Sort out bash_logouts
8) Change file structure so just have hostname for e.g. .bash_aliases in the
   folder
9) Eventually add in .bash config sourcing into bash_profile to reduce bash
   size/improve cohesion
10) sort out annoying colouring issue on bash for Thinkpad on vim
11) Sort out bash_prompts scripts
12) Look into prompt line for bash 
13)Install file: e.g. sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags for ctags.
14) Work out how to add font info to the .dotfiles pack.
15) Work out how to get vim plugins on .dotfiles - I guess they'll be done
    automatically but need install script to symlink them I guess. Install
    script will need symlink install early on?
