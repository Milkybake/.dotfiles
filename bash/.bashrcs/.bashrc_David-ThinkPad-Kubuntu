# There are 3 different types of shells in bash: the login shell, normal shell
# and interactive shell. Login shells read ~/.bash_profile and interactive shells
# read ~/.bashrc; in our setup, .bash_profile sources ~/.bashrc - thus all
# settings made here will also take effect in a login shell running bash.

# see examples at /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)

# NOTE: It is recommended to make language settings in ~/.profile rather than
# here, since multilingual X sessions would not work properly if LANG is over-
# ridden in every subshell.

# If not running interactively, don't do anything - as this a .bashrc
